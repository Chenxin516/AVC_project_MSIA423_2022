    <h4>VISION</h4>

    <p>
      Every year a lot of companies invest time and money in training both new and existing employees. Those companies aim to increase the effectiveness of their employees. However, every year many employees leave the companies because of various reasons like voluntary resignations, layoffs, illness, etc. It would be a waste of time and money if companies spend effort to hire and train those employees who would later leave the companies. Therefore, it would be important if companies can predict employee attrition in order to better allocate their resources.
    </p>

    <h4>MISSION</h4>

    <p>
      This project creates an app that can predict employees' attrition for a company. Employers will input a set of features of their employees to the app, then the app will predict the probability that their employees would attrite in the near future. The data of the project is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/employee-attrition"> Kaggle </a> dataset.
